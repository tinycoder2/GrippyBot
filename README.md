### Brief description of demo :
The red LED glows as soon as we click on the record button indicating that the recording has started. 
We control the servo motor by rotating the potentiometer knob. 
We click on the play button and the LED stops glowing and the recorded sequence plays in a loop with the LED flashing once for every iteration.
